# Nevy: Streamlined Networking for Bevy Game Engine 🌐

## Introduction 📢

Due to the extremely complex nature of networking in games, and the vast number of use cases Nevy wants to accomodate, development is currently ongoing and Nevy is not useable. The repo has been published so feedback can be provided and different APIs can be experimented and prototyped with in an iterative fashion.

If you are a game developer please check back in a few weeks and hopefully this project will be more applicable to you.
If you are a engine or networking developer and wish to contribute or have feedback, feel free to reach out in the bevy discord or my DMs (DrewDaPilot).
